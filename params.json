Join the mailing list **[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elloshare-discuss)**.\r\n\r\nElloShare is a photo sharing app for Android.  It integrates with Gallery to make it easy to post images from your phone\r\ninto Ello.  Use is simple.  Just [install it from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherlight.elloshare) and then use it either from the Launcher or from the sharing button in Gallery.\r\n\r\nImplementation is currently somewhay rough.  Please fork and modify.  Ello is about sharing art, and for many of us, that's mobile pictures.\r\n\r\nNone of this would have been possible without the [Ello research](https://gist.github.com/conatus/cc665f917d5558c123bc) done by github user [conatus](https://github.com/conatus).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
