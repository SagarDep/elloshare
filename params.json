Get an APK [here](http://www.weatherlight.com/elloshare).\r\nWant to get announcements about ElloShare?  Join the mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elloshare-discuss).\r\n\r\nElloShare is a photo sharing app for Android.  It integrates with Gallery to make it easy to post images from your phone\r\ninto Ello.  Use is simple.  First, [enable sideloading](http://lifehacker.com/5943562/how-to-sideload-android-apps) for your Android device.  Then, just download ElloShare using your device's browser or copy it to an SD card and install it.\r\n\r\nImplementation is currently VERY rough.  Please fork and modify.  Ello is about sharing art, and for many of us, that's mobile pictures.\r\n\r\nNone of this would have been possible without the [Ello research](https://gist.github.com/conatus/cc665f917d5558c123bc) done by github user [conatus](https://github.com/conatus).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
