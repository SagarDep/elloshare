Want to download and install ElloShare?  Get it  [on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherlight.elloshare).

ElloShare is a photo sharing app for Android.  It integrates with Gallery to make it easy to post images from your phone
into Ello.

Implementation is currently VERY rough.  Please fork and modify.  Ello is about sharing art, and for many of us, that's mobile pictures.

None of this would have been possible without the [Ello research](https://gist.github.com/conatus/cc665f917d5558c123bc) done by github user [conatus](https://github.com/conatus).
